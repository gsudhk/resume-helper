AI Resume Screener

An AI-powered tool to automatically screen resumes against job descriptions using semantic search and vector databases.
The system extracts skills from resumes, compares them with job descriptions, and provides:

1) Skills to Add
2)Skills to Remove
3) Match Score

üöÄ Features

1)Upload resume (PDF format).

2)Extracts text from resumes.

3)Embeds skills into vector space using semantic embeddings.

4)Stores resume embeddings in Qdrant Vector Database.

5)Accepts a job description as input.

6)Generates embeddings for the job description.

7)Performs semantic search between resume and job description embeddings.

8)Returns:

8.1)Skills to be added.

8.2)Skills to be removed.

8.3)Match score (%) between resume and job description.

‚öôÔ∏è Flow Explanation

Resume Upload (PDF)

User uploads a PDF resume.

PDF text is extracted and cleaned.

Embedding Creation

Resume text is converted into vector embeddings using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.).

Vector Storage (Qdrant)

Embeddings are stored in Qdrant Vector Database for efficient semantic similarity search.

Job Description Input

User pastes the job description.

The JD is also converted into embeddings.

Semantic Search

Resume embeddings are compared with JD embeddings.

Qdrant returns the most relevant matches (skills and keywords).

Result Generation

Extracts overlapping skills.

Identifies missing skills (Skills to Add).

Flags irrelevant skills (Skills to Remove).

Computes a Match Score (%) to quantify the resume-job fit.

üê≥ Running Qdrant with Docker

This project uses Qdrant as the vector database.
You can spin it up quickly with Docker:

docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant


Qdrant will be available at: http://localhost:6333

Default REST API ‚Üí http://localhost:6333

Default gRPC API ‚Üí http://localhost:6334

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS

Backend: FastAPI 

NLP: Embedding model (Groq)

Database: Qdrant Vector Database (via Docker)

PDF Processing: PyPDF2 

Frameworks: Langchain

üìå Future Enhancements

Multi-resume comparison for bulk hiring.

ATS-friendly resume formatting.

Advanced scoring metrics (weighting skills by importance).

Integration with LinkedIn/Job boards.
